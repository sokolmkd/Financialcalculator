# Financialcalculator
Project

This is a script which uses city level cost of living and purchasing power index information from Numbeo to calculate discretionary income estimates.

It prints out the results and saves them into a csv.
It is not entirely clear how to interpret these numbers.
It also calculates years to achieve a particular financial goal (e.g. for retirement) in each city.
The calculations might need a big review especially against Numbeo's own methodology.

We've also build an amazing [Instagram Email Scraper] (https://medium.com/@b_19859/instagram-email-scraper-c1c25bc1bb26) that pulls data from Instagram (locations, hashtags, profiles) and puts it in a nice csv file.

After that you can do all kinds of data analysis using python.
